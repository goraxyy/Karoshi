// Two black lids that slide in from the top and bottom of the screen until they meet in
// the middle, closing the player's eyes. Fully shut is total black — the lids overlap
// slightly so no hairline of the world survives between them.
//
// Built entirely in code on its own canvas, above every other, so the scene needs no UI
// authoring and nothing in the HUD shows through.
//
// Closed01 is the whole interface: 0 is wide open, 1 is shut. Blink, Close and Open are
// conveniences over it. Anything else can drive it directly instead — a cutscene, passing
// out from burnout, or a webcam tracking the player's real eyes — without touching this
// script, because nothing here decides *when* the eyes close, only what that looks like.
